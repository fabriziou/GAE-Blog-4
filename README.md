GAE-Blog
========

[My tiny GAE blog](http://zushenyan.appspot.com/)

A practice with Python and Google App Engine.
I built this blog with [this manual](http://brizzled.clapper.org/blog/2008/08/07/writing-blogging-software-for-google-app-engine/). It's really worth a read.

The code structure is very ugly, not nicely done. Hope you don't mind it's just an practice.
